1/4
Ukrainian lecturer & PhD here.
I’m building "Paternum" — an AI engine that teaches OODA loops and real-time decision-making under fire to my students and soldiers.
Right now, in December 2025, I’m losing the war against free-tier limits.
Help needed. 2/4
Colab dies every 20 min.
RunPod, Vast, Lambda — Ukrainian cards are blocked everywhere.
PayPal/Wise/Revolut — impossible or 25-30 % fees.
My free Grok-4 quota ends in days. Same with Claude, Perplexity, etc.
We restart dead training sessions at 3 AM with students.3/4
This is not about comfort.
Every hour of stable GPU = weeks of saved time = better model = someone who won’t freeze when seconds matter and drones are overhead.
I just need ANY working way to pay for:
• Grok-4 / SuperGrok
• Claude Opus
• RunPod / any decent cloud4/4
If you can share a team seat, send a gift subscription, or even just repost — you’re literally helping us build tools that save lives on the real frontline.
