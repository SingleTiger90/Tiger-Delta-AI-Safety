1. Technical Limitations & ConstraintsTigerΔ is a specialized L1 Entropy Shield, not a general-purpose security suite. It is important to define what it is not:Not a DPI Replacement: TigerΔ does not inspect payload. It cannot detect SQL injections or malware signatures.Lossy Compression: Folding 10D metadata into a 1D scalar involves information loss. Complex, low-volume APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) might stay under the radar of this specific heater-model.No "True" AI (Yet): Current implementation uses deterministic heuristics based on irrational constants ($\pi, \Phi$). It lacks neural inference or reinforcement learning.2. Terminology DeconstructionWhile we use bio-mimetic metaphors, the underlying engineering is based on Probabilistic Data Structures and Fast Non-Cryptographic Hashing:"Resonance" = Statistical convergence of packet arrival features."Fractal/Aperiodic" = Mitigation of hash collision attacks by rotating salt and rotation windows using irrational expansions.3. Strategic Roadmap (Evolution)To move TigerΔ from an R&D/PoC stage to a production-hardened tool, the following steps are planned:Formal Verification: Implementing a Coq or TLA+ model to prove the stability of the folding function.Adaptive Salt Rotation: Implementing a User-Space daemon that updates the PHI_FIXED and PI_FRAC constants in the eBPF maps every $N$ seconds to prevent adaptive attackers from synchronizing.Comparative Benchmarking: Running standardized tests using TRex or pktgen to compare CPU cycle consumption against nftables and Suricata.Hybrid Inference: Moving from static thresholds to a lightweight ML model in User-Space that adjusts the policy_map based on long-term traffic trends.
