"The ashes of Klaas beat upon my heart."
— Heinrich Heine
Delta Tiger is not a firewall.
It is a living digital immune system.An autonomous organism that breathes attack energy, purges entropy with the force of the attacker, and maintains balance through the golden ratio (Φ).It implements the Empty Fortress principle: the attacker builds the walls with their own energy — only to find nothing inside.Core PhilosophyAttack is not blocked.
It is transformed.
The stronger the strike, the cleaner the system becomes.
Nothing is free — purification costs mass (Father's Apparatus).
The system has two modes of existence: active breathing and deep rest.
Payload is never read — only its physical "weight" and "texture" are felt.

Key ComponentsMarker
Name
Role
Principle
Σ
SIMUL
String compactification & vibration sensing
Fixed-point folding + feedback chaos
Λ
LAGRANGE
Nonlinear gravitational trap
Curved space + sinusoidal harmonics
Φ
LUMIS
Adaptive core & metabolism
Exhale Protocol + Deep Rest Mode

Exhale ProtocolWhen attack pressure > 0.5:The system uses the incoming force to purge internal entropy.
Cost: reduction in defense_mass.
Result: the stronger the attack, the cleaner the system.

"100 births — 100 deaths. Balance preserved."
