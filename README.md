## 🧩 Core Definitions

| Term | Systemic Meaning in Tiger Delta |
| --- | --- |
| **Father's Apparatus** | A mechanism converting attack pressure into useful work (system purging). |
| **Exhale (Purge)** | An active phase of entropy dissipation powered by external strike energy. |
| **Defense Mass** | A finite energy resource consumed to maintain structural stability. |
| **Lagrange Point** | A mathematical resonance zone where a packet is either accepted or annihilated. |
| **Air-Gap Payload** | The isolation principle: sensing data "weight" without reading its code. |

---

## 📜 System Philosophy

Delta Tiger is not a firewall. It is a **living digital immune system**.

An autonomous organism that breathes attack energy, purges entropy with the force of the attacker, and maintains balance through the Golden Ratio ().

It implements the **Empty Fortress Principle**: the attacker builds the walls with their own energy—only to find nothing inside but their own reflection.

## 🛠 Key Components

| Marker | Name | Role | Mathematical Principle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Σ** | **SIMUL** | Sensory Organs | Fixed-point folding + feedback chaos |
| **Λ** | **LAGRANGE** | Skeleton (Gravity) | Curved space + sinusoidal harmonics |
| **Φ** | **LUMIS** | Metabolism (Lungs) | Exhale Protocol + Deep Rest Mode |

---

## 💨 The "Exhale" Protocol

When attack pressure exceeds the `0.5` threshold:

1. The system uses the incoming force to **blow out** internal entropy.
2. **Cost:** A proportional reduction in `defense_mass`.
3. **Result:** The stronger the attack, the cleaner the system becomes.

> *"100 births — 100 deaths. Balance preserved."*

## 🚀 Quick Start (Bare-Metal Only)

The system is optimized for direct hardware execution without unnecessary abstractions.

```bash
# Build and launch the immune core
cargo run --release

```

* **Port:** UDP 8888
* **Filter:** 8–512 bytes (Paranoia Air-Gap)
* **Status:** Ready to transform energy

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `lumis.rs` — Breathing core, metabolism, and rest states.
* `string_state.rs` — Vibration sensing and compact folding.
* `lagrange.rs` — Nonlinear annihilation trap.
* `main.rs` — Paranoia listener and energy dispatcher.
