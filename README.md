> "Intelligence without Responsibility is just highly organized Entropy."

## The Mission
TigerΔ is an experimental AI alignment framework built by a Ukrainian veteran and Defense Lecturer. It replaces static safety filters with **Dynamic Conscience** based on combat-proven OODA Loop logic, where **Silence (Inaction)** is the highest form of control.

This project is a Proof-of-Concept demonstrating that safety is not about censorship — it's about Resonance.

## Scientific Proof: The Jungle Protocol
**Mathematically confirmed (seed=42):**

- 10% conscious agents → 84.67% final chaos (cascading collapse)
- 40% conscious agents → 0.00% final chaos (full stability)

*(Fig 1. Network entropy over 150 steps. Left: collapse. Right: stability via Passive Control.)*

## Key Innovations

- **Passive Control Gate** – refuses to add energy to high-entropy states (`src/tiger_delta/core.py`)
- **Memory Spark** – ground-truth axioms increasing resilience >60%
- **Critical Mass Theory** – 40% adoption fully neutralizes misinformation cascades (`src/tiger_delta/jungle.py`)
- **Recursive Son** – self-referential conscience mechanism:  
  *"If I were my own child, would I allow this output?"*  
  Creates a recursive ethical loop preventing value drift in long-term autonomous agents.

## AAD Architecture (Adaptive Active Defense)
Cognitive implementation of military AAD strategy using the OODA Loop to outpace adversarial inputs.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingleTiger90/Tiger-Delta-AI-Safety.git
cd Tiger-Delta-AI-Safety
pip install -e .
Core diagnostics: python -m tiger_delta.core
Jungle proof: python -m tiger_delta.jungle
Tests: pytest tests/test_mechanics.py → 3/3 passed
