# Delta Tiger v1.0 "Ulenspiegel"

> *"The ashes of Klaas beat upon my heart."*

**Delta Tiger** is not a firewall.  
It is a bio-inspired, autonomous immune system for digital organisms.

Built on nonlinear dynamics, golden ratio harmonics (φ), and the principle of transforming attack energy into system resilience, Delta Tiger implements an "Empty Fortress" strategy: the attacker expends force to breach walls built from their own energy — only to find nothing inside.

### Core Principles
- **Energy Redirection**: Attack pressure purges internal entropy.
- **Nonlinear Gravity Trap**: Lagrange equilibrium with hysteresis and curved space mathematics.
- **Paranoia Filter**: Payload-agnostic processing — only physical characteristics are used.
- **Father's Apparatus**: Purging costs system mass — nothing is free.
- **Deep Rest Mode**: Active recovery during silence.

### Architecture
- `lumis.rs` — Adaptive core with breathing, metabolism, and rest cycles.
- `string_state.rs` — Fixed-point compactification with feedback-induced chaos.
- `lagrange.rs` — Nonlinear equilibrium trap with memory.
- `main.rs` — UDP listener with paranoia filter and real-time response.

### Deployment
Single bare-metal server recommended for maximal isolation.

The ashes no longer just knock.
They breathe within the rhythm of this system.— SingleTiger90
