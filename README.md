# 🐯 TigerΔ (Tiger Delta)
## Ulenspiegel — Platinum Core v3.3

**BIO-MIMETIC AUTONOMOUS DEFENSE SYSTEM**  
*Asynchronous Nerve Center for High-Entropy Environments*

> *“If you cannot predict the next microsecond, you cannot hit the target.”*

## 🧠 Philosophy

TigerΔ is not a firewall.  
TigerΔ is a **living defensive organism**.

Incoming attacks are treated as **physical energy**, not packets.  
Energy is absorbed, transformed, and converted into **defensive mass**.

We do not block reality — we **bend it**.

## ⚙ Core Concepts

### 🔻 Negative Radius
A saturation inversion state where linear prediction collapses.  
At this point, pattern-based attacks lose causality.

### 🩸 Scars Energy
Each neutralized threat leaves a **mathematical scar**.  
Scars are accumulated and reused to mutate internal resonance.

### ⚛ Mass–Energy Equivalence
Incoming energy increases internal inertia.
