**Delta Tiger** is not a firewall.  
It is a **living digital immune system** — a bio-inspired autonomous defense engine.

It implements the **Empty Fortress** strategy: the attacker expends all energy breaching walls built from their own force — only to find nothing inside.

## Core Philosophy
- Attack is not blocked — it is **transformed into system fuel**.
- The stronger the strike, the cleaner the system becomes.
- Payload is never inspected — only physical "weight" and "texture" are felt.
- Built in Rust for memory safety and zero-cost abstractions.

## Key Components

| Marker | Name      | Role                                      | Principle                          |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Σ      | SIMUL     | Vibration sensing & compactification      | Fixed-point folding + feedback chaos |
| Λ      | LAGRANGE  | Nonlinear gravitational trap              | Curved space + sinusoidal harmonics |
| Φ      | LUMIS     | Adaptive metabolism & breathing           | Exhale Protocol + Deep Rest Mode   |

## Exhale Protocol
When attack pressure > 0.5:
- Incoming force **purges internal entropy**.
- Cost: reduction in `defense_mass` (nothing is free).
- Balance: "100 births — 100 deaths."

## Quick Start (Bare-Metal Recommended)

```bash
cargo run --release
```

- Listens on UDP 8888
- Paranoia filter: 8–512 bytes only
- System ready to transform energy

## Repository Structure
- `lumis.rs` — adaptive core with breathing and deep rest mode
- `string_state.rs` — string compactification with feedback chaos
- `lagrange.rs` — nonlinear gravitational trap with hysteresis
- `main.rs` — paranoid UDP listener with energy redirection

The ashes of Klaas no longer knock.  
They breathe within the rhythm of this system.

### 📈 Non-linear Stability Metrics (The "Tiger" Curve)
Unlike linear defense systems where $O(n)$ complexity leads to exhaustion, Delta Tiger utilizes a state-space fold:

1. **Phase 1 (Idle):** Latency < 10μs.
2. **Phase 2 (Pressure):** Entropy increases, triggering the $\Phi$-Harmonic counter-resonance.
3. **Phase 3 (Exhale):** The system uses incoming packet energy to reset the internal `StringState`. 

**Mathematical Baseline:**
The energy redirection follows $E_r = \int \frac{\delta S}{\delta t} dt$, where $S$ is the entropy of the incoming flow.
### 📈 Projected Stability Curve ($S$ vs $P$)
$S$ = System Stability, $P$ = Network Pressure

Traditional (Linear):   Tiger Delta (Adaptive):
S |                     S |
  |  \                     |  _______ (Exhale Peak)
  |   \                    | /
  |____\____ P             |/_________ P
(System Crash)           (Self-Stabilizing)
