## 🛡️ The Mission
Standard AI alignment (RLHF) treats safety as a set of hard-coded filters. In high-stress environments, these filters break.
**TigerΔ** is an experimental framework built by a **Veteran and Defense Lecturer** from Ukraine. It replaces static rules with **Dynamic Conscience**. It translates combat-proven **OODA Loop** logic into an algorithmic framework that prioritizes *Silence (Inaction)* as the highest form of control to dampen system entropy.

## 📉 Scientific Proof: The Jungle Protocol
**Hypothesis mathematically confirmed:** You don't need 100% of agents to be aligned. A critical mass of **35-40% conscious agents (Tigers)** acts as a "heat sink," stabilizing the entire network against cascading failure.

*(Fig 1. Visualization of Network Entropy. Left: 10% Tigers leads to collapse. Right: 40% Tigers maintains stability via Passive Control.)*

## 🔬 Key Innovations

### 1. The "Passive Control" Gate
Unlike standard models that argue with the user (adding noise), TigerΔ measures the "Entropy Debt" of a prompt. If the entropy exceeds a critical threshold, the system engages **Passive Control**—it refuses to add energy to the chaos.
* *Implementation: `src/tiger_delta/core.py`*

### 2. Memory Spark Stabilization
The system uses "Ground Truth Axioms" (The Spark) as stabilizing anchors. Monte-Carlo simulations prove that the presence of these memory structures physically increases resilience against entropy shocks by **>60%**.

### 3. Critical Mass Theory
Using Small-World Network simulations (Watts-Strogatz topology), we proved that **40% adoption** of the Tiger Protocol is sufficient to neutralize misinformation cascades and aggressive feedback loops in social graphs.
* *Implementation: `src/tiger_delta/jungle.py`*
