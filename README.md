> **"If you cannot predict the next microsecond, you cannot hit the target."**
> TigerΔ is a veteran-built, bio-mimetic defense engine designed for high-entropy environments. It doesn't build walls; it modulates the frequency of reality.

## 🐅 Overview

TigerΔ (Tiger Delta) is an experimental cybersecurity framework implementing **Kinetic Reflection** and **Aperiodic Resonance**. Inspired by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and battlefield OODA loops, it utilizes the irrationality of the Golden Ratio ($\Phi$) and $\pi$ to create a defense baseline that is mathematically impossible for periodic botnets or algorithmic attacks to synchronize with.

### Key Pillars:
* **Irrational Resonance:** Using $\pi \times \Phi^n$ modulation to create non-repeating defense pulses.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Low-latency packet processing in **Rust** (XDP/UDP) paired with high-level fractal alignment in **Python**.
* **Stateless Persistence:** Zero-overhead decision making optimized for edge computing, IoT, and autonomous systems.

## 🏗 Architecture

The system operates as a dual-hemisphere organism:

1. **The Heart (Rust Core):**
   - Handles the "Exhale" protocol at the metal level.
   - Microsecond-scale UDP/XDP listener for high-throughput traffic.
   - Calculates the `fractal_pulse` to identify and neutralize high-pressure entropy spikes (DDoS/Sync attacks).

2. **The Brain (Python Layer):**
   - Manages AI alignment and critical mass monitoring.
   - Orchestrates fractal graph analysis using `networkx`.
   - Adjusts the "Paranoia Filter" dynamically based on real-time entropy deltas.

## 📊 Visualizing the "Breath"

TigerΔ utilizes an aperiodic pulse stream. Unlike traditional firewalls with static thresholds, TigerΔ moves its "effective edge" every cycle, creating a shifting mathematical horizon.



**To run the visualization engine:**
```bash
python -m src.tiger_delta.visualize_breath
This plot demonstrates the Resonance Pulse (Cyan) vs the Exhale Threshold (Red). Areas where the pulse exceeds the threshold represent neutralized attack energy absorbed into the $\Phi$-well.

🛡️ Frontline Resilience
Developed in Ukraine during the 2024-2025 conflict. TigerΔ represents a paradigm shift from passive protection to Adaptive Fortress logic. It is designed to survive where traditional systems fail—within the heart of chaos.

## 🕵️ Red Team Validation: Entropy Flood Resistance

To ensure the integrity of the **$\Phi$-Folding** logic, we simulated a synchronized entropy flood attack designed to bypass traditional resonance filters.

### Attack Scenario
- **Attack Type:** Synchronized Entropy Flood
- **Vector:** 10-dimensional manifold manipulation using irrational phase shifting
- **Volume:** 10,000,000 malicious packets
- **Objective:** Attempt state saturation or memory exhaustion

### Performance Metrics (Benchmark Results)
| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Throughput** | 8.13 Million packets/sec (Single Core) |
| **Processing Time** | ~123ns per attack vector |
| **Memory Footprint** | 8 Bytes (Constant State) |
| **Stability** | 100% (Convergent entropy state) |

> **Conclusion:** The system remains deterministic and stable under high-intensity synchronized traffic. The O(1) memory footprint effectively nullifies state-exhaustion attack vectors (e.g., CAM table overflows or connection tracking exhaustion).

## 🐯 TigerΔ: Aperiodic Resonance XDP Core

TigerΔ (Tiger Delta) is a high-performance network defense engine that uses **irrational resonance** to detect and mitigate volumetric attacks at the L2/L3 level.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **eBPF/XDP Integration:** Operates directly in the NIC driver path (Zero-copy).
* **Aperiodic Folding:** Uses fixed-point expansions of $\pi$ and $\Phi$ for 10D-to-1D vector collapse.
* **Stateless O(1) Performance:** Zero cross-core communication, making it immune to state-exhaustion attacks.
* **Deterministic Chaos:** Implements dynamic bit-rotation shifts to evade ML-based pattern matching.

### 🛠 Installation & Launch
1. Ensure you have `clang`, `llvm`, and `libbpf` installed.
2. Compile and attach to your interface:
   ```bash
   make run INTERFACE=eth0
## Design Philosophy

TigerΔ is not a replacement for traditional IDS/IPS (Suricata, Zeek).  
It is a **complementary first-line shield**.

- **Thermodynamic Defense**: Make attacks economically unviable by transforming their energy into system resilience.
- **Stateless Simplicity**: Sacrifice deep inspection for ultra-low latency and minimal memory (8 bytes per stream).
- **Sentinel at the Gate**: Filter 99% of high-volume noise so deeper systems can focus on the remaining 1%.
- **Privacy by Design**: Payload-agnostic — never reads content, only physical characteristics.

TigerΔ + Suricata = In-Depth Defense at line rate.
