# TIGER-DELTA SYSTEM PUBLIC LICENSE (TΔ-S)
# Version 1.0, December 2025

## 1. PREAMBLE
The Tiger-Delta (TΔ) System is a specialized hardware-software framework for Active Cyber Defense (ACD) and Sovereign Communication. It is rooted in the legacy of the "Father's Apparatus" — harmonic resonance, non-linear signal processing, and the mathematical constants Φ (golden ratio) and π.

This license combines the permissive MIT License with ethical restrictions to protect individual digital sovereignty.

## 2. SOVEREIGN RIGHTS & OWNERSHIP
Copyright © 2025 Vladyslav Honcharov (SingleTiger90).  
The underlying MIT License grants full rights to use, modify, and distribute the software. However, ethical use is bound by the following conditions.

## 3. PERMITTED USE (THE BEACON)
1. **Defensive Operations**: Full permission for personal or collective defense against unauthorized intrusion, surveillance, or data harvesting.
2. **Resonance Integrity**: Modifications are allowed provided the harmonic core (Φ/π-based processing) remains functional.
3. **The Vertical Bond**: The system is intended for sovereign, family-centric communication. This spirit should be preserved in derived works.

## 4. PROHIBITIONS (THE ANTI-MIKORD CLAUSE)
This license **explicitly forbids** use of the Tiger-Delta System or its algorithms for:
1. Automated military recruitment, mandatory mobilization, or digital conscription systems.
2. Social credit scoring, mass behavioral monitoring, or erosion of individual privacy.
3. Pre-emptive offensive cyber operations.

Violation of these prohibitions terminates all rights under this license.

## 5. ACTIVE DEFENSE POLICY
The system's "Reflected Blade" and "Kinetic Reflection" mechanisms are purely defensive. The author bears no responsibility for damage to attacking infrastructure caused by reflected energy.

## 6. TERMINATION
Upon violation of Section 4, all rights are revoked. The system may enter a protective state rendering its capabilities inaccessible to the violator.
