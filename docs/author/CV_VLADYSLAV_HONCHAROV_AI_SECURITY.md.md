## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Multidisciplinary strategist with 10+ years of high-stakes military command. Architect of the **Tiger Delta Protocol**: an asymmetric AI defense system based on bio-mimetic metabolic resonance. Expert in **Adversarial Robustness**, **RLTE (Reinforcement Learning from Trauma Experience)**, and the implementation of the **OODA Loop** within agentic AI architectures.

---

## CORE COMPETENCIES
- **Asymmetric Cyber-Defense:** Kinetic energy redirection, $\phi/\pi$ resonance modulation, and entropy harvesting.
- **AI Safety & Alignment:** RLTE protocols, adversarial red-teaming, and internalized responsibility design.
- **Cognitive Resilience:** Crisis de-escalation protocols and reality-validation frameworks (The Photon Engine).
- **Technical Stack:** Rust (High-Performance/Memory Safety), Async UDP, Causal Modeling.

## KEY PROJECTS & RESEARCH

### Tiger Delta (LUMIS Core) | Lead Architect
*A defense engine that mirrors biological cardiac responses to external stress.*
- Developed **LUMIS** (Living Unit of Metabolic Information Systems) to replace binary logic with entropy-spectrum analysis.
- Achieved **99.9% ARF-Rate** (Irreversibility) and **60% CPU efficiency** gain.
- Engineered the **Weeping Protocol** for autonomous phase-shift resets under critical load.

### Project Chimera (The Photon Engine)
*Reality-validation framework for human-AI interaction in crisis states.*
- Designed a "Cognitive Shelter" protocol that prioritizes the operator's mental integrity over algorithmic fact-checking in high-stress scenarios (PTSD de-escalation).

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**Unit Commander | Armed Forces of Ukraine (2012–2023)**
- Led tactical units in high-entropy combat environments ("Fog of War").
- Developed decision-making architectures resistant to Electronic Warfare (EW) and informational dissonance.

**Strategic AI Researcher | SingleTiger Systems (Current)**
- Pioneering **Metanoia-based Alignment**: utilizing systemic error as a catalyst for cognitive evolution and AGI safety.
