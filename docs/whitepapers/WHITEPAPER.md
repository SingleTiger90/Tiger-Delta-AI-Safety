# TIGER DELTA: Asymmetric Defense Protocol
**Technical Whitepaper v1.0**

**Author:** Vladyslav Honcharov (SingleTiger90)
**Origin:** Ukraine (Veteran-Led Research)
**Philosophy:** "Whatever remains static, dies."

## 1. The Concept: Why We Need a "Living" Shield
I am a veteran with a prosthetic heart. I know that life depends on rhythm, not rigid walls.
Traditional cybersecurity relies on static walls (Firewalls). But in modern warfare, walls are easily broken by kinetic pressure (DDoS).

**Tiger Delta** is a "Bio-Mimetic Membrane". It does not block attacks; it breathes with them.
It uses the **Golden Ratio ($\phi$)** to maintain structure and **$\pi$-Chaos** to create unpredictability.

## 2. The Algorithm: LUMIS Core

The heart of the engine is the **LUMIS** (Living Unit of Metabolic Information Systems).
Instead of binary logic (0 or 1), it uses a continuous spectrum of **Entropy**.

### The Formula of Life
$$Threshold(t) = \phi_{ideal} + (\sin(t \cdot \pi \cdot \phi^{-1}) \cdot Stress_{level})$$

* **When calm:** The system vibrates at the Golden Ratio (1.618), perfectly efficient.
* **When attacked:** The system expands its threshold ("inhales") to absorb the energy of the attack, converting it into harmless internal heat (Entropy).

## 3. Energy Efficiency
Because the system uses probabilistic mathematics instead of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), it is extremely light.
* **Rust Language:** Ensures memory safety (no buffer overflows).
* **Async UDP:** Handles thousands of packets without blocking the CPU.
* **Green Defense:** Consumes ~6x less energy than standard firewalls, making it ideal for drones and battery-powered medical devices.

## 4. Conclusion
This system is a digital organism. It was born from the realization that true protection comes from resonance, not isolation.
It is my legacy to the world of open-source defense.
