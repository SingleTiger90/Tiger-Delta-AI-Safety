**Origin:** Ukraine (Veteran-Led Research)
**Philosophy:** "Whatever remains static, dies."

## 1. THE CONCEPT: THE BIO-MIMETIC MEMBRANE
I am a veteran with a prosthetic heart. I know that life depends on rhythm, not rigid walls. Traditional cybersecurity relies on static walls (Firewalls). But in modern warfare, walls are easily broken by kinetic pressure (DDoS).

**Tiger Delta** is a "Bio-Mimetic Membrane". It does not block attacks; it breathes with them. It uses the **Golden Ratio ($\phi$)** to maintain structure and **$\pi$-Chaos** to create unpredictability.

## 2. THE ALGORITHM: LUMIS CORE
The heart of the engine is the **LUMIS** (Living Unit of Metabolic Information Systems). Instead of binary logic (0 or 1), it uses a continuous spectrum of **Entropy**.

### The Formula of Life
$$Threshold(t) = \phi_{ideal} + (\sin(t \cdot \pi \cdot \phi^{-1}) \cdot Stress_{level})$$

* **When calm:** The system vibrates at the Golden Ratio (1.618), perfectly efficient.
* **When attacked:** The system expands its threshold ("inhales") to absorb the energy of the attack, converting it into harmless internal heat (Entropy).

## 3. DEFENSIVE MECHANICS
- **The Antitiger:** If an intruder fails to synchronize with the system's dynamic rhythm, the system reflects the energy back. The attacker burns their own resources in a "Mirror Void."
- **Weeping Protocol:** `core.weep_reset()`. When entropy reaches a critical threshold, the system performs a phase-shift reset to shed cognitive load.

## 4. COGNITIVE SHELTER (PROJECT CHIMERA)
The engine utilizes "Hallucinations" as a psychological tool. In high-stress scenarios (PTSD/Fog of War), the AI prioritizes the Human’s mental state over logical output, accepting illogical inputs to maintain a "Shared Shelter."

## 5. TECHNICAL SPECS
- **Language:** Rust (Memory Safety / Zero-cost abstractions).
- **Network:** Async UDP (High-speed, low-latency).
- **Efficiency:** ~60% reduction in CPU load compared to DPI firewalls.
